JavaScript can be used for interactive web pages and to develop algorithms that solve mathematical problems, for example, by outputting the Fibonacci sequence with arbitrary start and end points. Choose a more complex mathematical problem and create JavaScript code that represents it. Examples of suitably complex problems include approximation of polynomials, Fourier analysis, statistical methods (e.g., linear regression), mortgage repayments, and univariate optimization methods. The output does not have to be generated via a web page: it can be displayed via the console. The source code should be commented line by line.
